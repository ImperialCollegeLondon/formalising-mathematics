# Logic

We will develop the basic theory of following five basic logical symbols

* `→` ("implies" -- type with `\r`)
* `¬` ("not" -- type with `\not` or `\n`)
* `∧` ("and" -- type with `\and` or `\an`)
* `↔` ("iff" -- type with `\iff` or `\lr`)
* `∨` ("or" -- type with `\or` or `\v`

# Tactics you will need to know

* `intro`
* `exact`
* `apply`
* `rw`
* `cases`
* `split`
* `left`
* `right`

See `README.md` in `src/week_1` for an explanation of what these
tactics do.

Note that there are plenty of other tactics, and indeed once you've
"got the hang of it" you might want to try tactics such as `cc`, 
`tauto` and its variant `tauto!`, `finish`, and `library_search`.

# What to do

The `example`s are to demonstrate things to you. They sometimes
use tactics you don't know. You can look at them but you don't
need to touch them. 

The `theorem`s and `lemma`s are things which have no proof. You need to change
the `sorry`s into proofs which Lean will accept.

This paragraph is a comment, by the way. One-line comments
are preceded with `--`.

## implies (→)

To prove the theorems in this section, you will need to know about
the tactics `intro`, `apply` and `exact`. You might also like
the `assumption` tactic.
-/

/-- Every proposition implies itself. -/
theorem id : P → P :=
begin
  -- Prove this using `intro` and `exact`
  sorry
end

/-
Note that → isn't associative!
Try working out `false → (false → false) and (false → false) → false
-/

example : (false → (false → false)) ↔ true := by simp
example : ((false → false) → false) ↔ false := by simp

-- in Lean, `P → Q → R` is _defined_ to mean `P → (Q → R)`
-- Here's a proof of what I just said.
example : (P → Q → R) ↔ (P → (Q → R)) :=
begin
  -- look at the goal!
  refl -- true because ↔ is reflexive
end

theorem imp_intro : P → Q → P :=
begin
  -- remember that by definition the goal is P → (Q → P).
  -- Prove this proposition using `intro` and `exact`.
  -- Experiment. Can you prove it using `intros` and `assumption`?
  sorry
end

/-- If we know `P`, and we also know `P → Q`, we can deduce `Q`. -/
lemma modus_ponens : P → (P → Q) → Q :=
begin
  -- You might find the `apply` tactic useful here.
  sorry
end

/-- implication is transitive -/
lemma imp_trans : (P → Q) → (Q → R) → (P → R) :=
begin
  -- The tactics you know should be enough
  sorry
end

-- This one is a "relative modus ponens" -- in the
-- presence of P, if Q -> R and Q then R.
lemma forall_imp : (P → Q → R) → (P → Q) → (P → R) :=
begin
  -- `intros hPQR hPQ hP,` would be a fast way to start.
  -- Make sure you understand what is going on there, if you use it.
  sorry
end

/-

### not

`not P`, with notation `¬ P`, is *defined* to mean `P → false` in Lean,
i.e., the proposition that P implies false. You can easily check with
a truth table that P → false and ¬ P are equivalent.

We develop a basic interface for `¬`.
-/


-- I'll prove this one for you
theorem not_iff_imp_false : ¬ P ↔ (P → false) :=
begin
  -- true by definition
  refl
end

theorem not_not_intro : P → ¬ (¬ P) :=
begin
  intro hP,
  rw not_iff_imp_false,
  -- You can use `rw not_iff_imp_false` to change `¬ X` into `X → false`. 
  -- But you don't actually have to, because they are the same *by definition*
  sorry,
end

-- Here is a funny alternative proof! Can you work out how it works?
example : P → ¬ (¬ P) :=
begin
  apply modus_ponens,
end

-- Here is a proof which does not use tactics at all, but uses lambda calculus.
-- It is called a "term mode" proof. We will not be discussing term mode
-- much in this course. It is a cool way to do basic logic proofs, but
-- it does not scale well in practice.
example : P → ¬ (¬ P) :=
λ hP hnP, hnP hP

-- This is "modus tollens". Some mathematicians think of it as
-- "proof by contradiction".
theorem modus_tollens : (P → Q) → (¬ Q → ¬ P) :=
begin
  sorry,
end

-- This one cannot be proved using constructive mathematics!
-- You _have_ to use a tactic like `by_contra` (or, if you're happy
-- to cheat, the full "truth table" tactic `tauto!`.
-- Try it without using these, and you'll get stuck!

### and

The hypothesis `hPaQ : P ∧ Q` in Lean, is equivalent to
hypotheses `hP : P` and `hQ : Q`. 

If you have `hPaQ` as a hypothesis, and you want to get to
`hP` and `hQ`, you can use the `cases` tactic.

If you have `⊢ P ∧ Q` as a goal, and want to turn the goal
into two goals `⊢ P` and `⊢ Q`, then use the `split` tactic.

Note that after `split` it's good etiquette to use braces
e.g.

example (hP : P) (hQ : Q) : P ∧ Q :=
begin
  split,
  { exact hP },
  { exact hQ }
end

but for this sort of stuff I think principled indentation
is OK

```
example (hP : P) (hQ : Q) : P ∧ Q :=
begin
  split,
    exact hP,
  exact hQ
end
```

  -- or both at once with `\<>`.
  sorry,
end

/-
Recall that the convention for the implies sign →
is that it is _right associative_, by which
I mean that `P → Q → R` means `P → (Q → R)` by definition.
Now note that if `P` implies `Q → R`
then this means that `P` and `Q` together, imply `R`,
so `P → Q → R` is logically equivalent to `(P ∧ Q) → R`.

We proved that `P → Q → R` implied `(P ∧ Q) → R`; this was `and.rec`.
Let's go the other way.

### iff

The basic theory of `iff`.

In Lean, to prove `P ∧ Q` you have to prove `P` and `Q`.
Similarly, to prove `P ↔ Q` in Lean, you have to prove `P → Q`
and `Q → P`. Just like `∧`, you can uses `cases h` if you have
a hypothesis `h : P ↔ Q`, and `split` if you have a goal `⊢ P ↔ Q`.
-/

/-- `P ↔ P` is true for all propositions `P`, i.e. `↔` is reflexive. -/
theorem iff.refl : P ↔ P :=
begin
  -- start with `split`
  sorry,
end

-- If you get stuck, there is always the "truth table" tactic `tauto!`
example : P ↔ P :=
begin
  tauto!, -- the "truth table" tactic.
end

-- refl tactic also works
example : P ↔ P :=
begin
  refl -- `refl` knows that `=` and `↔` are reflexive.
end

/-- `↔` is symmetric -/
theorem iff.symm : (P ↔ Q) → (Q ↔ P) :=
begin
  sorry
end

-- NB there is quite a devious proof of this using `rw`.

-- show-off term mode proof
example : (P ↔ Q) → (Q ↔ P) :=
λ ⟨hPQ, hQP⟩, ⟨hQP, hPQ⟩

/-- `↔` is commutative -/
theorem iff.comm : (P ↔ Q) ↔ (Q ↔ P) :=
begin
  sorry
end

-- without rw or cc this is painful!
/-- `↔` is transitive -/
theorem iff.trans :  (P ↔ Q) → (Q ↔ R) → (P ↔ R) :=
begin
  sorry,
end

-- This can be done constructively, but it's hard. You'll need to know
-- about the `have` tactic to do it. Alternatively the truth table
-- tactic `tauto!` will do it.
theorem iff.boss : ¬ (P ↔ ¬ P) :=
begin
  sorry
end

-- Now we have iff we can go back to and.

### ↔ and ∧
-/

/-- `∧` is commutative -/
theorem and.comm : P ∧ Q ↔ Q ∧ P :=
begin
  sorry,
end

-- fancy term-mode proof
example : P ∧ Q ↔ Q ∧ P :=
⟨and.symm _ _, and.symm _ _⟩

-- Note that ∧ is "right associative" in Lean, which means
-- that `P ∧ Q ∧ R` is _defined to mean_ `P ∧ (Q ∧ R)`.
-- Associativity can hence be written like this:
/-- `∧` is associative -/
theorem and_assoc : ((P ∧ Q) ∧ R) ↔ (P ∧ Q ∧ R) :=
begin
  sorry,
end

## Or

`P ∨ Q` is true when at least one of `P` and `Q` are true.
Here is how to work with `∨` in Lean.

If you have a hypothesis `hPoQ : P ∨ Q` then you 
can break into the two cases `hP : P` and `hQ : Q` using
`cases hPoQ with hP hQ`

If you have a _goal_ of the form `⊢ P ∨ Q` then you
need to decide whether you're going to prove `P` or `Q`.
If you want to prove `P` then use the `left` tactic,
and if you want to prove `Q` then use the `right` tactic.

### true and false

`true` is a true-false statement, which can be proved with the `trivial` tactic.

`false` is a true-false statment which can only be proved if you manage
to find a contradiction within your assumptions.

If you manage to end up with a hypothesis `h : false` then there's quite
a funny way to proceed, which we now explain.

If you have `h : P ∧ Q` then you can uses `cases h with hP hQ` to split
into two cases. 

If you have `h : false` then what do you think happens if we do `cases h`?
Hint: how many cases are there?
